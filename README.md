# Troubleshooting Package Installs

A lot of time it's because my version of node that gets used by default is 9.0.0. 

To fix this, just use Node Version Manager to switch the local version.

```shell
$ nvm use 8.0 #or whatever version of node you need
```

If it's missing, run `$ nvm install 8.0.0` or whatever version you need.
